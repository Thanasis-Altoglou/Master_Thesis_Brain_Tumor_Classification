# Master Thesis Title: Brain Tumor Binary Classification from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Network and VGG16 with Transfer Learning

Brain tumor is the abnormal mass in the cells form within the brain. Precise and accurate brain tumor detection in MRI images plays crucial role in clinical diagnosis and decision making for the treatment of the patients. Applying classical machine learning methods is a very challenging task for a non-expert because it is very time-consuming and prone to errors process. Recent advancement in deep learning has shown huge progress in healthcare, and convolutional neural networks displayed substantial results in image classification tasks.
